## Get Started Without a Framework
 

### Step 1: Creating a new application
    You can use React Native Community CLI to generate a new project. Let's create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":
    
        npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init AwesomeProject

### Step 2: Start Metro
    Metro is the JavaScript build tool for React Native. To start the Metro development server, run the following from your project folder:
    
        npm start

### Step 3: Start your application

    Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

    npm run android


### Step 4: Modifying your app

    
    Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.
    
    Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
    Press the R key twice or select Reload from the Dev Menu (Ctrl + M) to see your changes!
